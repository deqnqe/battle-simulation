# battle-simulation
To execute the program, classes Battle (which contains the main method), DPanel, DrawableImage, DrawableItem, Element, Animator should be in the src folder. Then it is needed to create new directory "Battle" and add there files back.wav (open it as Groovy), rock.png, paper.png, scissors.png. You might need to change '/' to '\\' or double'\\' in classes Battle and Element in the file path to run the code properly.
